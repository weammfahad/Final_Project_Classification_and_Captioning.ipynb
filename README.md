# Aircraft Damage Classification and Captioning

## Overview
This project was completed as the final project for the "Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras" course by IBM on Coursera.

The project uses transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture to classify aircraft damage and a pretrained Transformer model to generate image captions.

## Dataset
The project uses an aircraft damage dataset containing images labeled with damage types such as:
- Dent
- Crack

The dataset is used to train and evaluate the deep learning model.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Transfer Learning (VGG16)
- Transformer model
- Google Colab

## Project Workflow
The project includes the following steps:
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Feature extraction using pretrained VGG16
- Model training and evaluation
- Damage classification
- Image caption generation

## Project File
The implementation is available in the Jupyter Notebook file:
